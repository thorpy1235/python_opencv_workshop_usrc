Shape Finding 2
Great! We have less random noise and more shapes now. Next, we have to find all those hearts! Perhaps if we had a 
heart template, we could match the hearts in the image to the heart template. But all the hearts are of different sizes and rotations...

Fortunately, people smarter than we figured out that certain functions of the x and y coordinates of an image are 
invariant to the size, scaling and rotation of a shape. These are called the Hu-moments of the image, and we'll use them 
to our advantage here.

https://learnopencv.com/tag/hu-moments/

Hu Moments ( or rather Hu moment invariants ) are a set of 7 
numbers calculated using central moments that are invariant to
 image transformations. The first 6 moments have been proved to 
 be invariant to translation, scale, and rotation, and reflection. 
 While the 7th momentâ€™s sign changes for image reflection.
